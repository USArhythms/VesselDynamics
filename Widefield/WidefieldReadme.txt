Widefieldreadme.txt

The widefield folder will include code that extracts raw df/f data from fluorescence imaging tiffs.
Additional code includes processing (defining vasomotor peak, saving df/f(x,t)) and plotting
(computing the space-freq SVD and mapping magnitude/phase/additional statistics back to the vessel mask).
